How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Comparition faster than just using my eyes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Faster way to locate typos or undoing things

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I won't have to spend time checking and rewriting things. 
    The cons would be that I have to choose when I have to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Google Docs works with programs that only need one file, while Git is
    more focus on coding, which involved multiple kind of files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    In the shell terminal I am able to move to the right directory and compare
    the history of a file just introducing two ID's.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because backups will provide me extra security to modify files

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I hope that's something you're gonna teach me
